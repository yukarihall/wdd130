    <h2>Yukari Hall</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, this is Yukari Hall. I am originally from Japan. My family and I moved to Alberta Canada seven years ago. Canada is a beautiful country and we all enjoy living here.</p>
    <p>Canada's winter is pretty severe. Sometimes it gets minus 40 celsius. When snow blankets the entire ground, it is phenomenally beautiful.</p>
    <p>My husband is from Alberta, that is why we are here. He loves both countries evenly between Japan and Canada. He had been in Japan for 23years, no wonder he loves seafood as all Japanese do. You really can't avoid eating seafood if you live there for a long time. Oh, I miss REAL fresh sushi, sashimi(raw fish), crab, shrimp, and anything from the ocean.</p>
    <p>I have 4 children; the oldest is married in Provo, Utah some two years ago. Luckily it was right before COVID-19 hit, so we all could go to the states to celebrate him and his new bride's wedding. My second son is a college student, and third, my only daughter is willing to be a registered nurse. My baby boy is already in grade 10, but we have three more years to go with him home. He is a good all-around athlete and is now a football player. I can get to watch his playing for 3 more seasons. I can't complain!</p>
